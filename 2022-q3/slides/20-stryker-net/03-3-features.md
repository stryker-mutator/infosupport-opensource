# Features

- Markdown summary reporter (useful in for example pull requests) @guypritchard
- Allow users to choose to fail fast on failing initial tests @BlackGad
    this used to be default behavior,
    but was changed to only fail if a certain percentage of tests fail
    Users can now once again choose to enable this behavior
