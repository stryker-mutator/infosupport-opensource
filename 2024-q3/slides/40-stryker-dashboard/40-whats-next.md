### What's next?

1. Fix remaining bugs from Angular to Lit migration:
 - [#895](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/895): After viewing a report, the body of the website remains in the wrong color (fix is already in a PR).
 - [#893](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/893): Switching selected org on the repos page does not switch the url.

---

2. Improvements to the dashboard frontend:
 - [#890](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/890): When loading takes longer than `x` amount, show spinner.
 - [#891](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/891): Add searchbar to repositories page.

---

3. Azure DevOps:
 - [#885](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/885): Add support for Azure DevOps repositories (?)

4. Potentially shift focus to `stryker-elements`.
